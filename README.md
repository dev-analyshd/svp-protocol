Onchain infrastructure for programmable capital and real-world asset issuance.

Structured Value Protocol (SVP) is a financial-grade onchain infrastructure that enables businesses, institutions, and asset issuers to tokenize equity and value streams in a programmable and transparent manner.

SVP is not a marketplace — it is a protocol layer that provides structured share issuance, programmable capital logic, compliance-aware token standards (ERC-1400 inspired), and transparent onchain accounting.

The protocol enables businesses — from SMEs to large enterprises — to:

• Issue structured equity onchain
• Define shareholder rights and transfer rules
• Raise capital transparently
• Maintain programmable cap tables
• Distribute value through encoded financial logic

SVP aligns directly with Robinhood Chain’s mission of supporting tokenized real-world and digital assets by introducing a modular capital structuring layer optimized for financial-grade deployment.

Long term, SVP aims to become a universal value engine for tokenized real-world assets and programmable capital markets.
